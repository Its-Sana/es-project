# es-project
The goal of this project is to design and develop smart gloves that maintain an optimal temperature and provide the necessary warmth through efficient control.

Using appropriate heating elements such as resistive filaments or carbon fiber.
Integrating temperature sensors (such as DS18B20).
Controlling the systemâ€™s operation using a microcontroller (Arduino or ESP32).
Powering the gloves with rechargeable lithium-ion batteries.
Designing a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for system control.
Designing and sewing gloves using durable and comfortable fabric
